Light enters and all visible patches that can see the light become brigher
If a patch sees that another patch is lit it too will become lit.
This is the light scattering across a surface.
So with each pass the room becomes more visible because more and more patches
will become visible to what the light touches.

A surface is subdivided into a set of patches
from each patch perspective a hemicube is created and the scene is rendered
from all perspectives of the hemicube.
Lambert's Cosine Law is applied to tone the brightness from what is rendered from the hemicube
This is done multiple times until the desired light color is maintained on the surface
